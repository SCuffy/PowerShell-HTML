# PowerShell-HTML

Welcome to my repository for PowerShell scripts related to HTML data!

These scripts use Invoke-WebRequest to get information from websites, which can then be queried, downloaded etc.

## Search-HTML-Links
Search-HTML-Links checks the URLs that have been added as href links in the content, and displays the URLs that contain certain words.
